<h4> Free Verse </h4>

<div>
<h4> What it is: </h4>

<p>
While it is easy to think that poems have to rhyme, free verse is a type of poetry that does not require any rhyme scheme or meter. Poems written in free verse, however, do tend to employ other types of creative language such as alliteration, words that begin with the same sound, or assonance, the repetition of vowel sounds.
<br>
Some people find free verse to be a less restrictive type of poetry to write since it doesn't have to employ the form or the rhyming schemes of other types of poetry.

I now delight
<br>
In spite
<br>
Of the might
<br>
And the right
<br>
Of classic tradition,
<br>
In writing
<br>
And reciting
<br>
Straight ahead,
<br>
Without let or omission,
<br>
Just any little rhyme
<br>
In any little time
<br>
That runs in my head;
<br>
Because, I've said,
<br>
My rhymes no longer shall stand arrayed
<br>
Like Prussian soldiers on parade
<br>
That march,
<br>
Stiff as starch,
<br>
Foot to foot,
<br>
Boot to boot,
<br>
Blade to blade,
<br>
Button to button,
<br>
Cheeks and chops and chins like mutton.
<br>
No! No!
<br>
My rhymes must go
<br>
Turn 'ee, twist 'ee,
<br>
Twinkling, frosty,
<br>
Will-o'-the-wisp-like, misty;

<h4> Imagery </h4>

<div>
<h4> What it is: </h4>
<p>
These types of poems work to draw a picture in the mind of the reader, in order to give an extremely powerful image of what the writer is talking about. They work to intensify the senses of the reader.

NOW sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;
<br>
Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;
<br>
Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:
<br>
The firefly wakens: waken thou with me.
<br> <br>
    Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,
	<br>
And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.
<br> <br>
    Now lies the Earth all Danae to the stars,
	<br>
And all thy heart lies open unto me.
<br> <br>
    Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves
	<br>
A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.
<br> <br>
    Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,
	<br>
And slips into the bosom of the lake:
<br>
So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip
<br>
Into my bosom and be lost in me.

<h4> Ode </h4>

<div>
<h4> What it is: </h4>

<p>
An ode is a short lyric poem that praises an individual, an idea, or an event. In ancient Greece, odes were originally accompanied by music—in fact, the word “ode” comes from the Greek word aeidein, which means to sing or to chant. Odes are often ceremonial, and formal in tone.
