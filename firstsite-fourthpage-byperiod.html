        <div class="head">Historical evolution of poetry by period</div>
		<div class="nested">
        <div>Renaissance Poetry</div>
		<div>The Renaissance poetry era lasted from the 14th to 17th century. It was an era of poetry that brought artistic ideas and beliefs, human development and education. Most of this poetry was heavily influenced by the style of the Ancient Romans and Greeks. These poems reflected the views and feelings of people at that time. Also many poets of the time were inspired by love and many dedicated their work to love interests. Some poets of the time were John Skelton, Thomas Wyatt, and Henry VIII was actually something of a poet himself.</div>
        <div>Metaphysical Poetry</div>
		<div>Metaphysical poetry is poetry from the 17th century, and it is poetry that is a subtler, provocative lyric poetry movement that sought greater depth in its verse. The poets defined and compared their subjects through nature, philosophy, love and musings about the hereafter- a great departure from the primarily religious poetry that had been before. The poets sought to minimize their place within the poem and to look beyond the obvious. Some poets of that time were Samuel Cowley, John Donne, George Herbert, and Andrew Marvell.</div>
		<div>Elizabethan Poetry</div>
		<div>The Elizabethan poetry era was, as the name indicates, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. This era lasted from around 1558 to around 1603, and is commonly known as the 'Age of Shakespeare'. It was during this time that Shakespeare wrote his poems, and championed the use of the sonnet. also known as the 'Shakespearean sonnet'. Much of the style of this poem was borrowed from the former Renaissance period of poetry, and it was of the classical, lyrical style. Other poets from around this time were; Edmund Spencer, Philip Sydney, Walter Raleigh, and Christopher Marlow.</div>
		<div>Cavalier Poetry</div>
		<div>The term 'Cavalier poet' came from a school of English poets of the 17th century who supported King Charles I during the English civil war. Instead of discussing issues such as religion, philosophy and the arts, Cavalier poetry talked more often about celebratory topics and often promoted the works of King Charles. It is often grouped under the political catergory of poetry. Other charasteristics included metaphors and fantasy. The leading Cavalier poets were Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, Sir John Suckling, and Thomas Carew.</div>
		<div>Victorian Poetry</div>
		<div>The Victorian period lasted from approximately 1837 to 1901 during the reign of Queen Victoria, and it was the era that brought a new wave of poetry that was influenced by Romanticism. From the rich and rythmic quality to the lyrical purity and powerful exploration of loss and faith, Victorian was still distinctly different. It is the great age of whimsy and nonsense, where people wrote about God's existence, the occult and the mysterious. Some poets of the time were, Robert Browning, Alfred Tennyson, and Thomas Hardy.</div>
		<div>Romantic Poetry</div>
		<div>Romantic poetry was written during the Romantic literary movement, lasting from approximately 1800 to 1850, which emphasized emotion, nature and individuality. The era itself was an artistic, literary, and cultural era. Most poems written during this time were written with passion about love, including much emotion. Poets such as Willima Wordsworth were engaged in trying to create a new kind of poetry that emphasized intuition over reason. Alongside William Wordsworth, the best known Romantic poets were William Blake, Samuel T. Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, and John Keats.</div>
		<div>Modern Poetry</div>
		<div>Modern poetry refers to the verse created by the writers and poets of the 20th and 21st centuries. Some people would define modern poetry to include the poets of the 19th century, such as Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman. Recognizable aspects of modern poetry include an emphasis on strong imagery and emotional content and less reliance on the use of rhyme. American poet Walt Whitman, who published his influential book Leaves of Grass in 1855, is one of the founders of modern poetry. His disregard for traditional rhyme and meter led him to be called “the father of free verse”, and gave him a strong influence on later poets. Some poets from this era are Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson, and Arthur Symons.</div>
